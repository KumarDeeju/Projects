Introduction:
Simple Banking Application is a simple Java project for beginners to start their career in coding. You’ll learn about Scanner class to take inputs, and the basics of strings, loops, methods, and conditional statements. Here, simple banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, exit, etc. 

Explanation:
Java is a powerful programming language that is commonly used for building enterprise-level applications. One of the most popular application domains for Java is banking. Java provides a robust set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop a banking application.

In this article, we will take a look at how to build a simple banking application using Java. Our application will have the following basic functionality:

Check balance
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Exit the application
The first step in building our application is to create a new Java project. We will use the command-line interface to create a new project and set up the project structure. Once the project is set up, we can start writing the code for our application.

The main class of our application will be called “Bank”. In this class, we will define the main method and the basic functionality of our application. The main method will be responsible for displaying the menu to the user and handling the user’s input.

The menu will consist of four options:

Check balance
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Exit the application
The user will be prompted to select an option by entering a number between 1 and 4. If the user enters an invalid option, the application will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid option.
