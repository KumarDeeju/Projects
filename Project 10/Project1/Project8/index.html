                    One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

                    The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":

                        JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

                        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
                        
                        JavaScript is easy to learn.
                        
                        This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.

                            The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            You can skip the window keyword.

                            In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object.
                             This means that variables, properties, and methods by default
                              belong to the window object. This also means that specifying
                               the window keyword is optional:
                        </li>

                    In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

                    JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

                        JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming
                         language which is used by several websites for scripting the
                          webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming
                           language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when
                            applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 
                            1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator
                             browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical
                              web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web 
                              applications to interact directly without reloading the page
                               every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several
                                forms of interactivity and simplicity.

                        In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence.
                         In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized
                          that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language'
                           was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for
                            designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the 
                            company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed
                             Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan
                              could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding
                               Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft
                                over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were
                                 there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided 
                                 to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led
                                  to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the
                                   first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team
                                    replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons
                                     and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was 
                                     finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came
                                      into existence.

                A JavaScript global variable is declared outside the function 
                or declared with window object. It can be accessed from any function.
            </p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName);}
                    greetMe("World");
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName);}
                    greetMe("World");

                    A JavaScript global variable is declared outside the function
                     or declared with window object. It can be accessed from any function.

                    Letâ€™s see the simple example of global variable in JavaScript.

                    JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify 
                    type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine.
                     You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type
                      of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:
                </p>
