                <h2>Revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement:</h2>
                <p><break><b>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 
                    23 March 1931)</b> was a charismatic Indian
                     revolutionary[3] who participated in the
                      mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[4]
                       in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian
                        nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic 
                        bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger 
                        strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in 
                        -owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the
                         Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into 
                         a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing 
                         ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] he electrified a 
                         growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted 
                         urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's
                          nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's
                           independence.</break><br>

                    In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru,
                     both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
                      Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
                       British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is
                        today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for
                         the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
                          intended to assassinate.[9] They held Scott responsible for the
                           death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for
                            having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured
                             and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders 
                             exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single
                              bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.
                              As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by
                               Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.
                                Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an
                                 Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to
                                  give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.</p>
