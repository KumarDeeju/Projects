                    The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after
                     the emergence of sound film technology. Typically, the biggest difference 
                     between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery
                      and locations that would be impractical in a theater. Musical films
                       characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater; performers
                        often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching.

                    The 1930s through the early 1950s are considered to be the golden 
                    age of the musical film, when the genre's popularity was at its highest
                     in the Western world. Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the 
                     earliest Disney animated feature film, was a musical which won an
                      honorary Oscar for Walt Disney at the 11th Academy Awards.

                During the late 1940s and into the early 1950s,
                a production unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer headed by Arthur
                 Freed made the transition from old-fashioned musical films,
                  whose formula had become repetitive, to something new. (However,
                   they also produced Technicolor remakes of such musicals as Show Boat,
                    which had previously been filmed in the 1930s.) In 1939,

                    Director Damien Chazelle created a musical film called La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It was meant to reintroduce the traditional jazz style of song fnumbers with influences from the Golden Age of Hollywood.
                    The first Indian sound film, Ardeshir Irani's Alam Ara (1931), was a major commercial success.[13] There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals
